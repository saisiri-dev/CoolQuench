## 💧 CoolQuench – The Self-Cooling Water Bottle
🚀 An Innovative Solution for Refreshing Hydration Without Electricity

## 📖 Overview

CoolQuench is a smart water bottle prototype designed to keep your water cool anytime, anywhere – without the need for electricity or traditional refrigeration.
This project was developed as part of an idea presentation & prototyping challenge, focusing on sustainability, convenience, and innovation in everyday products.

## 🌍 Problem Identification

Access to cold drinking water is still a challenge during travel, outdoor activities, or power outages.

Existing solutions rely heavily on electricity-based refrigeration.

Need for a portable, eco-friendly, and energy-independent cooling solution.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

CoolQuench introduces a non-electric cooling mechanism that keeps water refreshingly cool on the go.

## 🔑 Key Features:

❄️ Self-Cooling Technology – no electricity required.

🌱 Eco-Friendly – sustainable, reusable, and portable.

🎒 Compact Design – easy to carry anywhere.

🧩 Prototype-Driven – built around practical usability.

🛠️ Prototype Development

Designed initial concept sketches & 3D models.

Built working prototype for testing efficiency.

Created a presentation (PPT) showcasing design, usability, and market feasibility.

## 📊 Competitive Advantage

Unlike thermos bottles (which only maintain temperature), CoolQuench actively cools water.

Affordable, electricity-free alternative to mini-coolers.

Appeals to both urban professionals and outdoor enthusiasts.

## 📈 Market Strategy

Target Market: Students, travelers, office-goers, outdoor enthusiasts.

Entry Strategy: Crowdfunding campaigns + partnerships with eco-friendly brands.

Future Scope: Expand into cooling food containers and sports accessories.
